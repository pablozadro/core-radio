# Core-Radio / Overview

Core-Radio is an implementation of the Publish/Subscribe pattern.

This pattern uses events to allow comunication between objects, decoupling the objects and avoiding dependencies between them.

The publishers trigger events, which can pass custom arguments, and the observers register to receive the events.
